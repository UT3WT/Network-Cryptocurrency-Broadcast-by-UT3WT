Network Cryptocurrency Broadcast by UT3WT

Using indicators of network traffic of pools and systems of mining, which ensure the process of mining,
create a conditional radio broadcast, which are in the usual sense for us, you can compare when you use the frequency control
tuning knob to the station, you hear music or radio broadcast of a specific radio station.

My own idea is based on the principles I recently published on the forum, where I created the relative definitions: crypto modulator,
crypto detector, crypto translator https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3053160.0 This idea leds me to the concept of
crypto-network-broadcast, in another way, processes that occur with crypto currencies and are transmitting by network protocols
and are a certain conditional spectrum (crypto-radio-broadcast) with certain variables.
Next step i use conception by Kotelnikov's theorem
https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0
it shows us that continuous signal can be expressed in the form of an interpolation string,  decided to convert it (digitize it)
and apply it to the sound band (frequency modulation,  amplitude, phase), and get a low frequency sound. As a result,
when I watch (listen) pool,  or Explorer of a certain coin I have to get the form of the spectrum and its sound,
which should be very interesting,  because crypto coins are more than 1500 now, it's hard to monitor work and look at the many indicators
that are expressed in figures, I propose to express them in the audio range, and the process of monitoring and mining to similar
music listen with a certain content,  I'm looking for a group of programmers to implement the first Crypto-radio,  crypto-television,
crypt-music, and more.
